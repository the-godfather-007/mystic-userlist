# mystic-bbs-userlist
A Mystic BBS Mod that allows for scrolling, ranking, and emailing members within the user list.
Tested on A49 Pre-Alpha and other version of Mystic BBS in both Linux and Windows.  Not tested for user bases above 400.

The purpose of this mod is to give SysOps more graniular visibility to the way users are interacting on their BBSes, utilizing the
Mystic BBSes traditional User list in a light bar, scrollable fashion, that when arrow keys left or right are pressed change the data and
ranks by the highlighted column.  The top rows being the highest ranking users in that given category.  This gives SysOps the opportunity
to see if more people are uploading, downloading, calling often, etc.. for 80x25 themed BBSes.  

The current state of this mod allows for any user or SysOp to also press [ENTER] to email the highlighted user.

**Not built out, contributors welcome** Future version will add scalable wide screen support where when the user calls in 132x80 themed BBSes more
data such as game play usage, and other flags can be set to custom tailor more data giving users and SysOps to BBS usage.  The "box" and data will need to
be flexible and add or subtract based on the users terminal mod up to 160c width and as low as 80c width.  This mod will not support  less than 80c.

Contributions are also always welcome for a groovy header file that is not "The Underground" Specific, but for now its what I have.
This mod is in beta test phase, and not supported at this time if troubles arise.  As always, use at your own risk.
